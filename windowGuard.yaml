blueprint:
  name: WindowGuard Climate Control
  description: >
    This blueprint intelligently manages your heating or cooling systems
    based on window sensor activity. It conserves energy by suspending climate control
    when a window is open and restores the HVAC mode to 'auto' after a user-defined delay when the window is closed.
